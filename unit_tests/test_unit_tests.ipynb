    "    -Answer: To get help from the CryoEM facility, you need to contact the facility to initiate the registration process. Once registered, you can use their online scheduler to book equipment time if you have ready-to-image cryo grids. If you need more assistance, have technical questions, or want to initiate a collaboration, you can contact the facility director, Dr. Zhiheng Yu, at yuz10@janelia.hhmi.org, or email cryoemfacility@janelia.hhmi.org.\n",

    "    -Question: what is neuronbridge\n",
    "    -Answer: NeuronBridge is a web application designed to facilitate the search for morphological matches between large data sets of neurons imaged using different modalities. It is particularly useful in neuroscience research involving Drosophila, where it helps researchers find similar neurons across various imaging techniques, such as electron microscopy and confocal light microscopy. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface, an extensible data model, a serverless cloud architecture, and a highly parallel image search engine. It supports the integration and reuse of its software code, open APIs, and processed data sets, and is available as a service to the neuroscience research community.\n",
