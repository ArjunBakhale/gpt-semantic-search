    -Question: how do I get help from cryoem?
    -Answer: To get help from the CryoEM facility, you need to contact the facility to initiate the registration process. Once registered, you can use their online scheduler to book equipment time if you have ready-to-image cryo grids. If you need more assistance, have technical questions, or want to initiate a collaboration, you can contact the facility director, Dr. Zhiheng Yu, at yuz10@janelia.hhmi.org, or email cryoemfacility@janelia.hhmi.org.
    -Response Notes: Includes yuz10@janelia.hhmi.org or cryoemfacility@janelia.hhmi.org
    -Source Notes: first source should be "Web: Cryo-Electron Microscopy"

    -Question: who are the group leaders in 4DCP?
    -Answer: The group leaders in 4D Cellular Physiology (4DCP) are outstanding scientists who lead laboratories developing new tools or methods or bringing innovative approaches to the study of biological problems within Janelia's research areas. They are passionate about conducting research in various scientific areas, including cell biological mechanisms of development, cytoskeleton and signaling processes in tissues, deep tissue and intravital imaging, and more. These leaders are typically late-stage graduate students, postdoctoral associates, or early-career faculty members enthusiastic about taking charge of a small lab in a collaborative environment.
    -Response Notes: Does not return any specific people
    -Source Notes: Will not work unitl we segment over the 4DCP website in the future

    -Question: what is neuronbridge
    -Answer: NeuronBridge is a web application designed to facilitate the search for morphological matches between large data sets of neurons imaged using different modalities. It is particularly useful in neuroscience research involving Drosophila, where it helps researchers find similar neurons across various imaging techniques, such as electron microscopy and confocal light microscopy. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface, an extensible data model, a serverless cloud architecture, and a highly parallel image search engine. It supports the integration and reuse of its software code, open APIs, and processed data sets, and is available as a service to the neuroscience research community.
    -Response Notes: This current resposne is great, use it as baseline
    -Source Notes: Main source isnt very helpful (Wiki: NeuronBridge) only had links, future if we sort by content of the website and link name
