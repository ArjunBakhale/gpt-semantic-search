It would be very useful to have some kind of decision tree to guide people to the appropriate resource.

At least the sharepoint part could be achievable since Microsoft is integrating OpenAI tech with their platforms. How nice would it be to say \"is there a frisbee club at Janelia?\" and receive the WhatsApp link and some info on last meeting? Or \"I'm interested in learning about AI\" and get a synopsis of CVML group, any Sci Comp Software IG, etc. Which makes me wonder about where to store new info, and if we shouldn't assume something like that is coming and put it in a Microsoft-associated system... like Github.\n",

      "We'll be moving the library to its own GitHub organization soon, which will hopefully make collaboration easier. But it does mean everyone will have to update their GitHub remotes.We've got some basic support for polarization, and U019XPGTGRL and UGF6L2YUS will be trying this out. We still need to add support for rotating elements relative to the propagation axis.I've made some changes to the Microscope so that they plug in a PSF module and a Sensor module, for which I'll be adding some more involved examples soon (instead of just `holoscope.ipynb`).U029DL61X5L reworked specifying trainable parameters so now you could initialize something with a function (e.g. a phase mask initialization function) without having that become trainable. Now you'll always have to wrap using `trainable` to mark something as trainable explicitly. Previously initializing something as a callable was coupled with marking that as a trainable parameter.We'll investigate why `Field`s can't be `vmap`ped, because this should be fixable. That way if you want to propagate to multiple `z` values and have multiple batches of these `z` values you won't have to write a wrapper function that creates a `Field` internally.After adding support for polarization, arbitrary batch dimensions, and the trainable rework, the public part of the library should start to become more stable. We have just a few more things to polish, especially documentation, before this is actually true .\n",

      "Title: Autocorrelation for image fusion of multiply aberrated detections\n",
      "Abstract: Cross-correlation represents a commonly used mathematical tool to estimate statistical properties in images, ranging from studying spatial distributions or temporal fluctuations of objects to estimation (and correction) of misalignments. In this seminar, we will briefly cover the special case of autocorrelation, which we employ to fuse multiple views of the same object subject to different point spread functions. Our idea stems from the fact that autocorrelation could be helpful for implicit realignment in optical computed tomography but can also enable access to reconstructions having a resolution higher than those obtained in real space. We discuss the logic behind the resolution improvement, validating the process experimentally using multi-view light-sheet imaging and SPAD array detection. With this work, we try to set a novel framework for image reconstruction that could be generically applied in any multi-view detection scheme, highlighting future research directions and current limitations of the method.\n",

SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated via multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multi-modal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.\n",
