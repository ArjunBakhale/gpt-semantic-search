Its a blockwise convolutional neural network prediction job so its embarrassingly parallel and scales almost linearly with number of gpus.

Right now it is a little higher at ~86% of the gpus because we had another node fail recent and the upgraded os node being out of the queue.  But there hasn't been high contention to encourage reducing it.

      "Title: Autocorrelation for image fusion of multiply aberrated detections\n",
      "Abstract: Cross-correlation represents a commonly used mathematical tool to estimate statistical properties in images, ranging from studying spatial distributions or temporal fluctuations of objects to estimation (and correction) of misalignments. In this seminar, we will briefly cover the special case of autocorrelation, which we employ to fuse multiple views of the same object subject to different point spread functions. Our idea stems from the fact that autocorrelation could be helpful for implicit realignment in optical computed tomography but can also enable access to reconstructions having a resolution higher than those obtained in real space. We discuss the logic behind the resolution improvement, validating the process experimentally using multi-view light-sheet imaging and SPAD array detection. With this work, we try to set a novel framework for image reconstruction that could be generically applied in any multi-view detection scheme, highlighting future research directions and current limitations of the method.\n",

Companies like kaggle could outsource some costly parts of their infrastructure to Modular. They are closed for now except getting people to work on their cloud using notebooks, which is good way to test their cloud service.

First, are physicians who respond for free on reddit (after taking time to get verified by mods) representative of the average physician? (I doubt it.) Second, there's no restriction for these online physicians to answer questions in any discipline. Pretty sure they don't check if they're licensed for the appropriate subject matter. Finally, the fact that it's online and unpaid, complete with pseudonyms, means they are likely to show even less empathy than they would in real-world settings. Chatbots don't behave differently in those settings. That said, I do think that AI advice makes sense if they can really address hallucination issues, even if it's quite rare.\n",

Training times under a day are the norm. At that pace, it doesn‚Äôt take long before the cumulative effect of all of these fine-tunings overcomes starting off at a size disadvantage. Indeed, in terms of engineer-hours, the pace of improvement from these models vastly outstrips what we can do with our largest variants, and the best are already largely indistinguishable from ChatGPT. Focusing on maintaining some of the largest models on the planet actually puts us at a disadvantage.\"\n",

They are making the same mistakes we are in their posture relative to open source, and their ability to maintain an edge is necessarily in question. Open source alternatives can and will eventually eclipse them unless they change their stance. In this respect, at least, we can make the first move.\"\n",

      "Abstract: Cross-correlation represents a commonly used mathematical tool to estimate statistical properties in images, ranging from studying spatial distributions or temporal fluctuations of objects to estimation (and correction) of misalignments. In this seminar, we will briefly cover the special case of autocorrelation, which we employ to fuse multiple views of the same object subject to different point spread functions. Our idea stems from the fact that autocorrelation could be helpful for implicit realignment in optical computed tomography but can also enable access to reconstructions having a resolution higher than those obtained in real space. We discuss the logic behind the resolution improvement, validating the process experimentally using multi-view light-sheet imaging and SPAD array detection. With this work, we try to set a novel framework for image reconstruction that could be generically applied in any multi-view detection scheme, highlighting future research directions and current limitations of the method.\n",

      "#1398 Allow batched/concurrent (de)compression support\n",
      "I have a proposal for an enhancement and would like to get feedback on this and potentially better ways of achieving the same goal.\n",
      "In many use cases that are read I/O bandwidth bound like in dataloaders for AI training, compression is typically turned off because that would end up being the bottleneck. We can get upwards of 10 GB/s of read throughput either from an object store or from a distributed filesystem like lustre. But CPU decompression typically maxes out at ~1 GB/s and that is usually with coarse grained multithreaded parallelism. A nice solution to this problem would be to decompress data on the GPU, which we can do at > 50 GB/s. This would make decompression no longer be the bottleneck while speeding up all other parts of the pipeline: lower use of storage, lower data volume fetched from storage, higher effective cache capacity if caching locally and faster CPU-GPU transfers. The issue with any kind of parallel decompression is that the API needs to support batched or concurrent decompression rather than calling decompression on chunks serially in a loop.\n",
      "Here is some data comparing throughput of some GPU decompression algorithms in nvcomp to multithreaded zstd on the CPU:  \n",
      "<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6964110/233476737-69eb0966-2031-49ca-9553-b2eb5dce95e3.png|decomp_throughput>\n",
      "This is conceptually similar to <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/547|#547> with concurrent chunk accesses, but for compression/decompression.\n",
      "The idea is to allow `Codec`s in numcodecs to implement a `batched_encode` and `batched_decode` in addition to the current `encode` and `decode` methods. When a codec has these methods available, zarr can dispatch a batch of chunks for encode/decode. The codec implementation can then either use a serial loop, multi-threaded parallelism or parallelize on the GPU using nvcomp. I'm envisioning this to be quite similar to `getitems` here:\n",
      "<https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/2ff887548496855706c69a3c5983b00f17025af6/zarr/core.py#L2061|zarr-python/zarr/core.py>\n",

      "From a GPU (de)compression standpoint, we have thought about using the sharding transformer format in ZEP0002 as the internal format in nvcomp. But after some consideration, this batched compression approach seems much more useful because:\n",
      "1. We can start using GPU decompression with existing zarr datasets that don't have the shard structure. The new sharding format would make GPU compression/decompression much more efficient but would not be required for functionality.\n",
      "2. We can support GPU decompression when accessing subset of chunks within a shard or from multiple shards, like when slicing along a dimension.\n",
      "3. We wouldn't have to add any new shard access api in zarr or multi-dimensional aware codec implementations.\n",
      "4. We don't need to have separate CPU and GPU codec implementations using the same underlying compression algorithm. For example, we can just have a single LZ4 codec that can use the GPU if available in batched mode or use the CPU multi-threaded path or just single threaded on the CPU. So data compressed with a GPU will be directly compatible with CPU decompression allowing users to not require a GPU to decompress a file.\n",

      "Jody Clements said: In that case, i would suggest using postman or apachebench, which don‚Äôt care about CORS headers and will provide stats on the request times, etc.  \n",
      "Stuart Berg said: Attempting to script this use-case would be quite painful, sadly. \n",
      "Jody Clements said: Are you not just changing the x,y coordinates, maybe the layer or zoom level for a single dataset?\n",
      "Stuart Berg said: One question is whether neuroglancer issues 100 concurrent requests to DVID in both the http1 and http2 scenarios.  A related question is whether and how the requests are cancelled in each scenario when the user navigates to a new area before the original data chunks have been served.  I was hoping to just play around with two different neuroglancer windows and watch kibana in each case.\n",
      "It would be nice if DVID could just provide its own CORS headers, but unfortunately those would then override the CORS headers from nginx.  I don't recall exactly why that's a problem, but I remember that it has been a problem in the past.\n",
      "Jody Clements said: You need to have either nginx or dvid provide the headers, because nginx wont replace existing headers, but will add to them, which will result in duplicate headers. If the browser receives duplicate headers it will fail the request.\n",
      "Jody Clements said: As for the behavior of neuroglancer, I doubt it is doing anything different based on the HTTP protocol. I would think that is all handled by the browsers dispatch mechanisms.\n",
      "Stuart Berg said: I'm not so sure about that.   Http1 doesn't support concurrent requests over a single connection, nor does it support cancellation.  So my theory is that the number of concurrent requests is constrained by the number of web worker threads in neuroglancer.  I'm not sure, though... Maybe neuroglancer just opens 100 connections spread across 10 worker threads?\n",
      "And then there's the question of what Nginx actually DOES with the requests.  How does multiplexing work in the http1 case vs. the http2 case?  I know nginx is incapable of using http2 on the backend side... So when it's using http2 on the front-end side and http1 on the backend side, then I have the same question: Does it open 100 independent connections to DVID, or does it queue the requests internally?\n",
      "The answer to that question may have ramifications for which requests are subject to cancelation when neuroglancer decides it no longer needs a chunk that it had just requested moments ago.  Since DVID can't actually handle cancelation properly, then there's a chance that we might have shot ourselves in the foot by switching to http2.  With http2, neuroglancer has the ability to send a ton of requests... Does it now do so with new-found impunity, since it believes all of those requests can be safely cancelled if necessary?  Is sending 100 concurrent requests something it didn't do previously (whether it was by design or due to practical limitations)?\n",
      "Stuart Berg said: Anyway, I think the easiest way to get a handle on these questions would be to fool around with it for a while and see what I can observe.  I don't know precisely which tests to run, which is why scripting them in advance would be a bummer.\n",
      "Stuart Berg said: Or, a related question: How does one control the multiplexing behavior in nginx?  Diagrams https://www.nginx.com/blog/http2-module-nginx/#multiplexing show that nginx will open multiple http1 connections to the backend... But how many?  My (very brief) search didn't yield an explanation of the config settings to control that.\n",
      "Jody Clements said: I have always used the defaults and never looked into changing how nginx is sending requests to the proxied backend servers.\n",
      "Stuart Berg said: Is there ANY way to get Chrome (or Firefox) to temporarily ignore CORS violations?  Using a setting in the developer tools window, perhaps?\n",
      "Stuart Berg said: Or maybe is there something I could add in my `/etc/hosts` file as a workaround?  Maybe that's the answer...\n",
      "Jody Clements said: There is a flag you can set, but it will disable all CORS for all sites and it is not easy to turn off or on\n",
      "Jody Clements said: Modifying the hosts file will probably not work, I presume you are trying to load data from a different domain.\n",

      "> In this tutorial we demonstrate how to call Julia libraries with multiple threads from C++. With the introduction of Julia 1.9 in May 2023, the runtime can dynamically \"adopt\" external threads, enabling the integration of Julia libraries into multi-threaded codebases written in other languages, such as C++. This article is written in collaboration with <https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangelos-paradas/|Evangelos Paradas>, the maestro of algorithm deployment at ASML.\n",
      "...\n",
      "> We encountered a pitfall with Java, when embedding our library into Spark. In this article, we will not go into the details of passing Java threads (via C++) to Julia, but we noticed some issues with the Java signal handler. Make sure that your library is explicitly aware of the Java signal handling library, for example via `export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libjsig.so` . Otherwise Julia will produce a segmentation fault and your application will crash. This is some kind of language interoperability issue that we had to circumvent.\n",

One idea would be to widen types from `string` to `string | array` , and if a `string` is supplied, use that string to load the data, but for in-memory arrays users would just pass in an instance of `array` without ever thinking about strings.\n",
      "But another idea would be to use strings like `memory://$VARNAME`, then dispatch on the protocol part of the url (`memory` ) in this case, and then look up `$VARNAME` from `locals()` .

      "Mark Kittisopikul said: I think you are starting to rehash some of Plan 9's concepts:\n",
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs\n",
      "Under Plan 9, UNIX's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file metaphor is extended via a pervasive network-centric https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system\n",
      "Plan 9 from Bell Labs\n",
      "Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a distributed operating system which originated from the Computing Science Research Center (CSRC) at Bell Labs in the mid-1980s and built on UNIX concepts first developed there in the late 1960s. Since 2000, Plan 9 has been free and open-source. The final official release was in early 2015.\n",
      "Under Plan 9, UNIX's everything is a file metaphor is extended via a pervasive network-centric filesystem, and the cursor-addressed, terminal-based I/O at the heart of UNIX-like operating systems is replaced by a windowing system and graphical user interface without cursor addressing, although rc, the Plan 9 shell, is text-based.\n",
      "The name Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a reference to the Ed Wood 1957 cult science fiction Z-movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. The system continues to be used and developed by operating system researchers and hobbyists.\n",
      "Everything is a file\n",
      "Everything is a file is an idea that Unix, and its derivatives, handle input/output to and from resources such as documents, hard-drives, modems, keyboards, printers and even some inter-process and network communications as simple streams of bytes exposed through the filesystem name space. Exceptions include shared memory, semaphores, datagram sockets, symbolic links, directories (which are read-only, and are not accessed as a byte-stream), processes and threads.\n",
      "The advantage of this approach is that the same set of tools, utilities and APIs can be used on a wide range of resources and a number of file types. When a file is opened, a file descriptor is created, using the file path as an addressing system. The file descriptor is then a byte stream I/O interface on which file operations are performed. Additionally, file descriptors are also created for objects such as anonymous pipes and network sockets - and therefore a more accurate description of this feature is Everything is a file descriptor.Additionally, a range of pseudo and virtual filesystems exists which exposes information about processes and other system information in a hierarchical file-like structure. These are mounted into the single file hierarchy.\n",
      "An example of this purely virtual filesystem is under /proc that exposes many system properties as files.  All of these files, in the broader sense of the word, have standard Unix file attributes such as an owner and access permissions, and can be queried by the same classic Unix tools and filters.  However, this is not universally considered a fast or portable approach. Some operating systems do not even mount /proc by default due to security or speed concerns.  It is, though, used heavily by both the widely installed BusyBox on embedded systems and by procps, which is used on most Linux systems. In both cases it is used in implementations of process-related POSIX shell commands. It is similarly used on Android systems in the operating system's Toolbox program.\n",
      "Mark Kittisopikul said: In a way, you could think of your named memory segments as being similar to POSIX shared memory. That is memory with an associated path. Really your `string` is a path, I believe.\n",

      "Ken Carlile said: Hi Daniel, that's actually pretty good from what I've seen, assuming I'm understanding the parameters correctly. First off, was this a transfer to a Globus Connect Personal endpoint? From the logs, it looks like it was. I can see this in the Event log, on the last page: https://app.globus.org/activity/ab12b762-eb6b-11ed-ba3d-09d6a6f08166/events?page=188\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: If I look under the first Started, entry, I see this:\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: `{`\n",
      "`  \"type\": \"GridFTP Transfer\",`\n",
      "`  \"concurrency\": 4,`\n",
      "`  \"protocol\": \"Mode S\"`\n",
      "`}`\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: So this means that there are 4 streams going at one time from our Globus Connect Server cluster to a single GCP node, which is just fine and normal for this setup. However, if this was a GCServer->GCServer transfer, it would probably say something like concurrency: 8, parallelism: 8. Mode S is the slowest way Globus can send data.\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: Unfortunately, Mode S is the only thing available when the node receiving the data is running GCPersonal. (GCServer is very involved setup, so typically that would only be done on an institutional level)\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: If a GCPersonal node is sending data to a GCServer, the concurrency and threading would look different, potentially, and it would probably be running faster.\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: It is possible, but I haven't confirmed this, that GCPersonal->GCPersonal would be faster than GCServer->GCPersonal, and regardless, that would be slower than server->server\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: So the TL;DR of that chunk of info is that if at all possible, both sides should use their Institution's Globus installs rather than transferring directly to a laptop or desktop running GCPersonal for the best speed.\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: Another thing that I see from the transfer is that it was set up with the option `transfer new or changed files where the checksum is different (sync level 3)`\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: This option is fairly computationally intensive as both sides have to run checksums on the files on both ends. If this is not necessary (ie, if this is the first transfer and not a re-sync) I recommend against using this option. However, it is fairly important to use it if it is a re-sync.\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: `Verify file integrity after transfer` is a similar case, and again, a very necessary and highly recommended option! But it does add some extra time to the transfer.\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: I point these out because the reported speed in the Globus console is \"Effective Speed\"\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: This means taking the entire size of the transfer and dividing it by the time taken for the entire operation. If you look in the Event log under the Progress entries, you'll see the actual transfer rate for each chunk of files (or chunk of a file), e.g.:\n",
      "<image.png>\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: In this case, the on-the-wire transfer rate is 225MB/s, which is pretty good for commodity internet.\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: But because the system is using Mode S, it needs to do checksums, and it needs to do the verification, the total time elapsed makes the effective speed much lower.\n",
      "Ken Carlile said: I checked your logs to make sure there were no interruptions/faults, and it looks like this one was just fine. Globus is designed to be resilient to these things, but I have seen instances where the person receiving the data has closed their laptop for the night and then opened it in the morning--the transfer then resumes just fine, but the effective speed is drastically reduced, because as far as Globus is concerned, the transfer's just taking that long. Other instances have included using an external USB drive on the receiving end that is, perhaps, a little hinky, and Globus will have to retransmit a chunk of data or an entire file (or more), which will again increase the overall time. The only way I found out about that was Globus engineers looking at the internal logging on the transfer, so I don't think it's something you would be able to see.\n",

How nice would it be to say \"is there a frisbee club at Janelia?\" and receive the WhatsApp link and some info on last meeting?

We used to do two track imaging and DAPI is imaged together with the AF546 channel. In this case, we observed bleed through from DAPI channel into AF546 channel. So we corrected for the bleed through. The heuristic cross-talk correction has the following steps:\n",

      "Here's a summary:\n",
      "We'll be moving the library to its own GitHub organization soon, which will hopefully make collaboration easier. But it does mean everyone will have to update their GitHub remotes.We've got some basic support for polarization, and U019XPGTGRL and UGF6L2YUS will be trying this out. We still need to add support for rotating elements relative to the propagation axis.I've made some changes to the Microscope so that they plug in a PSF module and a Sensor module, for which I'll be adding some more involved examples soon (instead of just `holoscope.ipynb`).U029DL61X5L reworked specifying trainable parameters so now you could initialize something with a function (e.g. a phase mask initialization function) without having that become trainable. Now you'll always have to wrap using `trainable` to mark something as trainable explicitly. Previously initializing something as a callable was coupled with marking that as a trainable parameter.We'll investigate why `Field`s can't be `vmap`ped, because this should be fixable. That way if you want to propagate to multiple `z` values and have multiple batches of these `z` values you won't have to write a wrapper function that creates a `Field` internally.After adding support for polarization, arbitrary batch dimensions, and the trainable rework, the public part of the library should start to become more stable. We have just a few more things to polish, especially documentation, before this is actually true .\n",

Right now it is a little higher at ~86% of the gpus because we had another node fail recent and the upgraded os node being out of the queue.  But there hasn't been high contention to encourage reducing it.  All of that is to say that the 150 number may change without notice but it won't kill your jobs if you end up exceeding the limit it will just not start new jobs until you are below the limit.\n",
