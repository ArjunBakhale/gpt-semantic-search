We can help with research and engineering tasks,\\nproviding everything from help with a quick question to full software life\\ncycle support. You can find a recent recording that tries to summarize our\\ndepartment on YouTube.\\n\\n## Skills\\n\\nOur team’s software skills span a broad range of\\n\\n  * programming languages (e.g. Java, Python, Julia, C++, Matlab)\\n  * extendable applications (e.g. Fiji, Napari, BigDataViewer, Neuroglancer)\\n  * frameworks (e.g. NumPy/SciPy, ImgLib2, PyTorch, Spark, Dask)\\n  * cloud & cluster technologies (e.g. storage and distributed compute on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud & Janelia cluster, containerization)\\n  * databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB).\\n\\nIn addition to software skills, our team has deep domain knowledge in image\\nprocessing, machine learning, (large) data handling, electron and light\\nmicroscopy, instrument control, 3D graphics & visualization as well as\\nbioformatics & transcriptomics and many of us have worked in biology, so we\\ncan efficiently work with experimentalists and computer scientists! Almost\\nhalf of our team members have earned PhDs, in areas including computer\\nengineering, electrical engineering, physics, biology, biochemistry, and\\ncomputational neuroscience. To have an overview and/or find a good person to\\ntalk to we maintain a skills matrix on the wiki.\\n\\n## Our Goals\\n\\nIt is very important for us to identify opportunities for code reuse, reducing\\ndevelopment overhead and support costs across Janelia. To achieve this we are\\nstrong proponents of open science and for example teamed up with the\\nComputation & Theory research area (C&T) to create the Open Science Software\\nInitiative. Additionally, most of our software is open source and available\\nvia GitHub.\\n\\nWe strive to be an active part of Janelia's scientific community and you will\\nsee us attending presentations and interest groups. Additionally, SciComp\\nSoftware is holding walk-in Office Hours every Tuesday at 1pm, and we are\\norganizing a series of Scientific Computing Interest Groups that welcomes all\\nJanelians (also available on the Hughes Hub calendar). Most interest groups\\nare recorded and can be accessed through Panopto internally, while some of\\nthem are publicly available on our YouTube channel.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to working with you!\\n\\n## Organization / Structure of SciComp Software\\n\\nThe director of SciComp Software is Stephan Preibisch and it consists of three\\nteams: Software Engineering headed by Konrad Rokicki, Computational Methods\\nand Solutions, both headed by Stephan Preibisch. Each of the teams runs it's\\nown internal team meetings. The entire group attends Monday morning meetings,\\nof which the science meetings are open to interested parties. SciComp\\norganizes the Scientific Computing Associate (SCA) program that embeds SCA's\\nin SciComp and the lab or team they work with. The Scientific Computing\\nInterest Groups are run by SciComp engineers and SCA's. The Open Science\\nSoftware Initiative is a collaboration between C&T and SciComp.\\n\\n##  Projects & Tools\\n\\n► NeuronBridge  \\nFind neuron matches across modalities\\n\\n► HortaCloud  \\nA cloud-based collaborative annotation system for terabyte-scale sparse volume\\nannotation\\n\\n► VVD Viewer  \\nVolumetric renderer for 3D/4D microscopy data\\n\\n► EASI-FISH pipeline  \\nPortable pipeline for end-to-end analysis of spatial transcriptomics data\\n\\n► Render  \\nWeb services for image transformation\\n\\n► RS-FISH  \\nPrecise, interactive, fast, and scalable FISH spot detection\\n\\n► BigStitcher  \\nEfficient alignment of multi-tile and multi-angle image datasets\\n\\n* * *\\nSee also this curated list of Janelia software that is actively maintained\\neither by Scientific Computing or individual labs.\\n\\n##  Scientific Computing Associates Program\\n\\nLooking for a wealth of challenging assignments that will satisfy your thirst\\nfor cutting-edge science, leverage and build on your coding skills, and launch\\nyour career in Computational Science?  \\n  \\nYou may find a perfect fit in Janelia’s new Scientific Computing Associates\\nprogram.\\n\\nApply Today\\n\\nsource: Web\\ntitle: Scientific Computing Systems\\nlink: https://www.janelia.org/support-team/scientific-computing-systems\\n\\nSupport Teams / Scientific Computing Systems\\n\\n##  What We Do\\n\\nWorld class computational infrastructure for Janelia’s science.\\n\\nThe department operates and maintains all of Janelia’s storage and associated\\nbackup infrastructure, high performance compute cluster, and all Linux\\nsystems.

Now What?\\n\\nby Stephen Plaza, Manager of FlyEM & Connectome Research Team Leader  \\nJune 17, 2019\\n\\nYou toil for years perfecting brain sample preparation and imaging techniques.\\nApplying the latest deep learning techniques to your data produces amazing\\nautomated neuron segmentation, sometimes to near perfection (see figure\\nbelow). Now real neuroscience can begin … well not necessarily.\\n\\nring-neurons-drosophila.png\\n\\nDespite the amazing advances in the connectomics field, the largest\\ncomprehensive connectomes produced are only hundreds of neurons, with a few\\nlarger efforts driven mostly by manual tracing. Our group is now\\nreconstructing a dataset encompassing a significant portion of the fly brain\\n(the “hemibrain” dataset) with over 20,000 neurons, where the connectomics\\ngroup at Google generated a state-of-the-art initial image segmentation. While\\nsome neurons appear to segment perfectly, there are also examples of major\\nmorphological errors, large false mergers or false splits. We cannot simply\\nuse, as is, the automated connectivity mapping.\\n\\nFurthermore, even if there are no obvious errors, it is often difficult to\\nconfidently assess accuracy without extensive validation. (In the fly, we can\\noften validate morphology using confocal data of different neuron types, where\\navailable.) . The situation undoubtedly improves after more experience as one\\ncould presumably bootstrap one reconstruction from an earlier connectome.\\n\\nPut simply, we require at least some validation for the first connectome of a\\ngiven brain region using new automated techniques. (We will elaborate on\\nvalidation strategies in future blog entries.) However, even without extensive\\nvalidation, we can do the following:\\n\\n  * Explore the broad connectivity between brain compartments (the projectome), assuming several long-range neurons are mostly segmented correctly.\\n  * Similarly, analyze the boundary between different compartments, as general statistics of the interface are likely minimally impacted by a small number of false merges and splits. \\n  * Determine the density of synaptic connectivity across each compartment.\\n  * With advanced semi-automated editing tools (such as our NeuTu and neu3 tool), sparsely trace individual neurons (often in minutes) to answer specific connectivity questions. This compares favorably to the days/weeks/months required for purely manual tracing.\\n  * Match (partially) segmented neuron morphologies to previous reconstructions (from EM or light) or to other neurons in the same dataset using a tool like NBLAST.\\u200b\\n\\nA great segmentation does not (yet) equal a connectome.

Almost\\nhalf of our team members have earned PhDs, in areas including computer\\nengineering, electrical engineering, physics, biology, biochemistry, and\\ncomputational neuroscience. To have an overview and/or find a good person to\\ntalk to we maintain a skills matrix on the wiki.\\n\\n## Our Goals\\n\\nIt is very important for us to identify opportunities for code reuse, reducing\\ndevelopment overhead and support costs across Janelia. To achieve this we are\\nstrong proponents of open science and for example teamed up with the\\nComputation & Theory research area (C&T) to create the Open Science Software\\nInitiative. Additionally, most of our software is open source and available\\nvia GitHub.\\n\\nWe strive to be an active part of Janelia's scientific community and you will\\nsee us attending presentations and interest groups. Additionally, SciComp\\nSoftware is holding walk-in Office Hours every Tuesday at 1pm, and we are\\norganizing a series of Scientific Computing Interest Groups that welcomes all\\nJanelians (also available on the Hughes Hub calendar).
