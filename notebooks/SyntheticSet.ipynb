The group is also responsible for maintaining Janelia’s data center\\nas well as backup and disaster recovery resources located at HHMI’s\\nheadquarters.\\n\\nThe data production and analysis at Janelia has experienced dramatic growth\\nsince the opening of the Institute. The department supports data storage\\ninfrastructure for storing and accessing scientific data. The group currently\\nsupports over 15 petabytes of scientific data split across various storage\\ntiers. Scientific Computing Systems supports a state-of-the-art storage and\\ncompute infrastructure across 2 data centers connected with an optical fiber\\nring. The department maintains a 4500 sq ft data center capable of providing\\nover 250 watts per square foot of power and cooling capacity of 300 tons. The\\ndata center and the building are backed up by three 2000 kW generators.\\n\\nThe mountain of data produced by Janelia’s scientists needs to be analyzed and\\nmined for useful information. The department supports a Linux compute cluster\\nwith over 5000 cores and 300 GPUs and is augmented by a variety of cloud-based\\nresources. In addition, the department is responsible for maintaining many\\nother Linux servers and workstations. Almost 100TB of new Janelia’s data is\\nsafely backed up every month to a secondary data center situated at HHMI’s\\nheadquarters in Chevy Chase as well as the cloud archive storage.\\n\\nsource: Web\\ntitle: Scientific Computing Software\\nlink: https://www.janelia.org/support-team/scientific-computing-software\\n\\nSupport Teams / Scientific Computing Software\\n\\n##  What We Do\\n\\nScientific Computing Software works closely with Janelia's labs, project\\nteams, and shared resources. We can help with research and engineering tasks,\\nproviding everything from help with a quick question to full software life\\ncycle support. You can find a recent recording that tries to summarize our\\ndepartment on YouTube.\\n\\n## Skills\\n\\nOur team’s software skills span a broad range of\\n\\n  * programming languages (e.g. Java, Python, Julia, C++, Matlab)\\n  * extendable applications (e.g. Fiji, Napari, BigDataViewer, Neuroglancer)\\n  * frameworks (e.g. NumPy/SciPy, ImgLib2, PyTorch, Spark, Dask)\\n  * cloud & cluster technologies (e.g. storage and distributed compute on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud & Janelia cluster, containerization)\\n  * databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB).\\n\\nIn addition to software skills, our team has deep domain knowledge in image\\nprocessing, machine learning, (large) data handling, electron and light\\nmicroscopy, instrument control, 3D graphics & visualization as well as\\nbioformatics & transcriptomics and many of us have worked in biology, so we\\ncan efficiently work with experimentalists and computer scientists! Almost\\nhalf of our team members have earned PhDs, in areas including computer\\nengineering, electrical engineering, physics, biology, biochemistry, and\\ncomputational neuroscience. To have an overview and/or find a good person to\\ntalk to we maintain a skills matrix on the wiki.\\n\\n## Our Goals\\n\\nIt is very important for us to identify opportunities for code reuse, reducing\\ndevelopment overhead and support costs across Janelia. To achieve this we are\\nstrong proponents of open science and for example teamed up with the\\nComputation & Theory research area (C&T) to create the Open Science Software\\nInitiative. Additionally, most of our software is open source and available\\nvia GitHub.\\n\\nWe strive to be an active part of Janelia's scientific community and you will\\nsee us attending presentations and interest groups. Additionally, SciComp\\nSoftware is holding walk-in Office Hours every Tuesday at 1pm, and we are\\norganizing a series of Scientific Computing Interest Groups that welcomes all\\nJanelians (also available on the Hughes Hub calendar). Most interest groups\\nare recorded and can be accessed through Panopto internally, while some of\\nthem are publicly available on our YouTube channel.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to working with you!\\n\\n## Organization / Structure of SciComp Software\\n\\nThe director of SciComp Software is Stephan Preibisch and it consists of three\\nteams: Software Engineering headed by Konrad Rokicki, Computational Methods\\nand Solutions, both headed by Stephan Preibisch. Each of the teams runs it's\\nown internal team meetings. The entire group attends Monday morning meetings,\\nof which the science meetings are open to interested parties. SciComp\\norganizes the Scientific Computing Associate (SCA) program that embeds SCA's\\nin SciComp and the lab or team they work with. The Scientific Computing\\nInterest Groups are run by SciComp engineers and SCA's. The Open Science\\nSoftware Initiative is a collaboration between C&T and SciComp.\\n\\n##  Projects & Tools\\n\\n► NeuronBridge  \\nFind neuron matches across modalities\\n\\n► HortaCloud  \\nA cloud-based collaborative annotation system for terabyte-scale sparse volume\\nannotation\\n\\n► VVD Viewer  \\nVolumetric renderer for 3D/4D microscopy data\\n\\n► EASI-FISH pipeline  \\nPortable pipeline for end-to-end analysis of spatial transcriptomics data\\n\\n► Render  \\nWeb services for image transformation\\n\\n► RS-FISH  \\nPrecise, interactive, fast, and scalable FISH spot detection\\n\\n► BigStitcher  \\nEfficient alignment of multi-tile and multi-angle image datasets\\n\\n* * *\\nSee also this curated list of Janelia software that is actively maintained\\neither by Scientific Computing or individual labs.\\n\\n##  Scientific Computing Associates Program\\n\\nLooking for a wealth of challenging assignments that will satisfy your thirst\\nfor cutting-edge science, leverage and build on your coding skills, and launch\\nyour career in Computational Science?  \\n  \\nYou may find a perfect fit in Janelia’s new Scientific Computing Associates\\nprogram.\\n\\nApply Today\\n\\nsource: Web\\ntitle: Scientific Computing Software - Team Members\\nlink: https://www.janelia.org/support-team/scientific-computing-software/members\\n\\nScientific Computing Software /  Team Members\\n\\n## Team\\n\\n* * *\\nView Bio\\n\\nDirector, Scientific Computing Software\\n\\nStephan Preibisch\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nDavid Ackerman\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nPrincipal Software Engineer\\n\\nBen Arthur\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nManager of Software Solutions and Connectomics Software Lead\\n\\nStuart Berg\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nTemporary Scientific Computing Analyst\\n\\nDiyi Chen\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nPrincipal Software Engineer\\n\\nJody Clements\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSoftware Engineer\\n\\nGreg Fleishman\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Associate\\n\\nShihong Max Gao\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nCristian Goina\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nGary Huang\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nPrincipal Software Engineer\\n\\nPhilip Hubbard\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Software Engineer\\n\\nMichael Innerberger\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nPrincipal Software Engineer\\n\\nWilliam Katz\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nTakashi Kawase\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Associate\\n\\nAnirudha Kemtur\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSoftware Engineer\\n\\nMark Kittisopikul\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nDonald Olbris\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nData Scientist\\n\\nHideo Otsuna\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Associate\\n\\nNarayan Anirudh Palutla\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Associate\\n\\nXi Peng\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Associate\\n\\nNorma Perez\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nManager, Software Engineering\\n\\nKonrad Rokicki\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nDavid Schauder\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Associate\\n\\nJoanne Sheppard\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nPrincipal Engineer and Project Manager\\n\\nRob Svirskas\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nAdam Taylor\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nPrincipal Software Engineer\\n\\nEric Trautman\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nScientific Computing Associate\\n\\nAllison Truhlar\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSenior Software Engineer\\n\\nRoman Vaxenburg\\n\\nView Bio\\n\\nSoftware Engineer\\n\\nMarwan Zouinkhi\\n\\n## Lab Coordinator\\n\\n* * *\\nView Bio\\n\\nLab Administration Coordinator\\n\\nEmilia Missing\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: How does the Janelia Scientific Computing team support the institute's mission and drive innovation in modern biological research?\\nAnswer: \"}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0}}\n",

We can help with research and engineering tasks,\\nproviding everything from help with a quick question to full software life\\ncycle support. You can find a recent recording that tries to summarize our\\ndepartment on YouTube.\\n\\n## Skills\\n\\nOur team’s software skills span a broad range of\\n\\n  * programming languages (e.g. Java, Python, Julia, C++, Matlab)\\n  * extendable applications (e.g. Fiji, Napari, BigDataViewer, Neuroglancer)\\n  * frameworks (e.g. NumPy/SciPy, ImgLib2, PyTorch, Spark, Dask)\\n  * cloud & cluster technologies (e.g. storage and distributed compute on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud & Janelia cluster, containerization)\\n  * databases (e.g. MySQL, MongoDB).\\n\\nIn addition to software skills, our team has deep domain knowledge in image\\nprocessing, machine learning, (large) data handling, electron and light\\nmicroscopy, instrument control, 3D graphics & visualization as well as\\nbioformatics & transcriptomics and many of us have worked in biology, so we\\ncan efficiently work with experimentalists and computer scientists! Almost\\nhalf of our team members have earned PhDs, in areas including computer\\nengineering, electrical engineering, physics, biology, biochemistry, and\\ncomputational neuroscience. To have an overview and/or find a good person to\\ntalk to we maintain a skills matrix on the wiki.\\n\\n## Our Goals\\n\\nIt is very important for us to identify opportunities for code reuse, reducing\\ndevelopment overhead and support costs across Janelia. To achieve this we are\\nstrong proponents of open science and for example teamed up with the\\nComputation & Theory research area (C&T) to create the Open Science Software\\nInitiative. Additionally, most of our software is open source and available\\nvia GitHub.\\n\\nWe strive to be an active part of Janelia's scientific community and you will\\nsee us attending presentations and interest groups. Additionally, SciComp\\nSoftware is holding walk-in Office Hours every Tuesday at 1pm, and we are\\norganizing a series of Scientific Computing Interest Groups that welcomes all\\nJanelians (also available on the Hughes Hub calendar). Most interest groups\\nare recorded and can be accessed through Panopto internally, while some of\\nthem are publicly available on our YouTube channel.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to working with you!\\n\\n## Organization / Structure of SciComp Software\\n\\nThe director of SciComp Software is Stephan Preibisch and it consists of three\\nteams: Software Engineering headed by Konrad Rokicki, Computational Methods\\nand Solutions, both headed by Stephan Preibisch. Each of the teams runs it's\\nown internal team meetings. The entire group attends Monday morning meetings,\\nof which the science meetings are open to interested parties. SciComp\\norganizes the Scientific Computing Associate (SCA) program that embeds SCA's\\nin SciComp and the lab or team they work with. The Scientific Computing\\nInterest Groups are run by SciComp engineers and SCA's. The Open Science\\nSoftware Initiative is a collaboration between C&T and SciComp.\\n\\n##  Projects & Tools\\n\\n► NeuronBridge  \\nFind neuron matches across modalities\\n\\n► HortaCloud  \\nA cloud-based collaborative annotation system for terabyte-scale sparse volume\\nannotation\\n\\n► VVD Viewer  \\nVolumetric renderer for 3D/4D microscopy data\\n\\n► EASI-FISH pipeline  \\nPortable pipeline for end-to-end analysis of spatial transcriptomics data\\n\\n► Render  \\nWeb services for image transformation\\n\\n► RS-FISH  \\nPrecise, interactive, fast, and scalable FISH spot detection\\n\\n► BigStitcher  \\nEfficient alignment of multi-tile and multi-angle image datasets\\n\\n* * *\\nSee also this curated list of Janelia software that is actively maintained\\neither by Scientific Computing or individual labs.\\n\\n##  Scientific Computing Associates Program\\n\\nLooking for a wealth of challenging assignments that will satisfy your thirst\\nfor cutting-edge science, leverage and build on your coding skills, and launch\\nyour career in Computational Science?  \\n  \\nYou may find a perfect fit in Janelia’s new Scientific Computing Associates\\nprogram.\\n\\nApply Today\\n\\nsource: Web\\ntitle: Scientific Computing Systems\\nlink: https://www.janelia.org/support-team/scientific-computing-systems\\n\\nSupport Teams / Scientific Computing Systems\\n\\n##  What We Do\\n\\nWorld class computational infrastructure for Janelia’s science.\\n\\nThe department operates and maintains all of Janelia’s storage and associated\\nbackup infrastructure, high performance compute cluster, and all Linux\\nsystems.

Glutamatergic\\nsynapses are dense in the vertebrate brain, at \\\\textasciitilde1/μm3. Glutamate\\nis released from and onto diverse components of the nervous system, including\\nneurons, glia, and other cells. Methods for glutamate detection are critically\\nimportant for understanding the function of synapses and neural circuits in\\nnormal physiology, development, and disease. Here we describe the development,\\noptimization, and deployment of genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate\\nindicators. We review the theoretical considerations governing glutamate\\nsensor properties from first principles of synapse biology, microscopy, and\\nprotein structure-function relationships. We provide case studies of the\\nstate-of-the-art iGluSnFR glutamate sensor, encompassing design and\\noptimization, mechanism of action, in vivo imaging, data analysis, and future\\ndirections. We include detailed protocols for iGluSnFR imaging in common\\npreparations (bacteria, cell culture, and brain slices) and model organisms\\n(worm, fly, fish, rodent).\\n\\n##  Janelia Authors\\n\\nAbhi Aggarwal\\n\\nAmelia Waring\\n\\nJonathan Marvin\\n\\nKaspar Podgorski\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: How does the Janelia team use Neuroglancer to enhance data visualization in neuroscience research?\\nAnswer: '}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0}}\n",
