They have deep domain knowledge in image processing, machine learning, data handling, electron and light microscopy, instrument control, 3D graphics & visualization, bioinformatics & transcriptomics. Many team members have backgrounds in biology, enabling them to work efficiently with experimentalists and computer scientists.\\n\\nThe team is also involved in various projects and tools such as NeuronBridge, HortaCloud, VVD Viewer, EASI-FISH pipeline, Render, RS-FISH, and BigStitcher, which are designed to support advanced imaging techniques and data analysis in neuroscience, cell biology, and bioinformatics.\\n\\nFurthermore, the team is a strong proponent of open science and has teamed up with the Computation & Theory research area to create the Open Science Software Initiative. Most of their software is open source and available via GitHub, promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing. They also run the Scientific Computing Associates program, which embeds associates in SciComp and the lab or team they work with.\"]\n",
